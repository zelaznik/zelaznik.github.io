    If you're reading this code, odds are you're a potential employeer.
    Using html frames does harken back to the 1990's, where GeoCities
    was king.  So I should justify why I made this choice.

    http://*.github.io pages don't allow for much more than static html pages.
    This was an easy way to be able to link minesweeper to my personal site,
    while being able to deploy more advanced features via heroku.

    If you'd like to check out the original source code, you can follow the link
    to the heroku page, or you can go to the following github page:
